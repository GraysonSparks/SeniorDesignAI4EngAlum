"""Notify Advancement staff when a visitor leaves a follow-up request (Story 10), and email the
giving questions the assistant couldn't answer once the visitor is done chatting.

leads.save_request() calls notify() after the request is stored; app.py calls notify_unanswered()
when the widget reports a finished chat's unanswered questions. Those questions are emailed and
never stored. The delivery channel depends on where the assistant is hosted, which the
Engineering web team decides, so it is chosen by env var:

    NOTIFY_CHANNEL=none     (default) nothing is sent; requests are only stored
    NOTIFY_CHANNEL=email    send an email through SMTP_HOST to NOTIFY_TO
    NOTIFY_CHANNEL=webhook  POST JSON to NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL (Teams / Power Automate / Slack flow)

Advancement chose email, sent to Ed Collari (NOTIFY_TO defaults to config.FALLBACK_EMAIL). Set
NOTIFY_ROUTED_STAFF=1 to also email the staff member the visitor asked for.

A failed notification never fails the visitor's request: the request is already stored, and the
error is logged so staff can check the requests file.
